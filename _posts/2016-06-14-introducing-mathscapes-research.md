Flashback → 2008. I was already in awe of prime numbers and was quick (and naive?) to assume that this is possibly the solution to information compression. Already being acquainted with computer programming, I started to write algorithms to compress information using prime numbers and gradually realized why such algorithms are not practical enough despite being theoretically valid.

But the entire process made me sufficiently curious to be driven by the idea of optimal algorithms and computational complexity to start a company that will fundamentally create and design algorithms that are instrumental in the advancement of technology.

And with this objective along with other two similar projects, I began BetaSpark in the year 2008 and however, things always remained under the hood. Only after completing my post graduation, I was able to contribute more time on this and started explicating the long term vision and the philosophy. And while I was finishing writing the first draft of the vision, I thought of changing the name to reflect the philosophy and paradigm of the organization. It is now called Mathscapes Research. Following is the excerpt from the long shot vision that I have envisioned for Mathscapes.

## Mathscapes design optimal algorithms with mathematics.

Mathematics is what I think, is the framework for abstraction and logic. It is the single most powerful language to decode and design. Constantly looking for the patterns that can help create better algorithms. They are at the heart of technology.

Often the most simple looking problems are the hardest. Finding just a solution do not suffice — most of our resources are limited, and optimal algorithms will allow better utilization of resources. This very point brings us to Mathematics — it sets up the foundation for us to theorize the patterns, conjectures, and design algorithms that are not just correct but efficient too.

> “Abstraction consists essentially in the creation and utilization of ambiguity.” .. “Logic moves in one direction, the direction of clarity, coherence, and structure. Ambiguity moves in the other direction, that of fluidity, openness, and release. Mathematics moves back and forth between these two poles. .. It is the interaction between these different aspects that gives mathematics its power.”  — William Byers (How Mathematicians Think, Princeton University Press, 2007)

## Mathscapes’ pursuit is to transform the way the world engages with technology.

Technology is constantly changing our world. It is everything that is making our work or life simpler. While that may be a good thing, we cannot not anticipate all the implications. Who should be held responsible for damage caused by this advancement? What if we could see the future? Would we change our decisions then?

Technology is what we believe is the consequence of life. Like life, technology may also be inevitable, or maybe both are same? We are probably at the ascent of the exponential curve of the supermassive technology outbreak. How much exaggerating it may sound, it seems inevitable. Will we able to coexist with it? And If so, how technology should evolve optimally? What should we do now to change the future?

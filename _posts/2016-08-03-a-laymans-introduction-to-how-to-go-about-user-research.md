This article does not discuss any user experience research methods but highlights a very generic process that I believe. Like all the other kinds of research, User research is quite critical to the subsequent design process and thus is as much important as the process of design itself. Or to put in another way, the essential part is to understand that it is indeed part of the design itself.

Users wouldn't always know or tell you what they need. Research is a necessary part of the process to identify the real needs of the user to create meaningful and valuable experiences for them. And I'm using the word 'need' in a very loose sense. It could mean their requirements, aspirations, or even their pain-points. An essential responsibility of a user researcher is to identify tools and methods to identify these 'needs.' While there are multiple methods and tools researchers have come up with based on the specific contexts, this post is instead going to focus on a general approach a user researcher might take.

And the approach is not straight forward always. There are real-world challenges, but more importantly, circumstances that are part of being in a studio or company that shape which informs your approach and could affect end-results of your research.

## Don't immediately get to the solution
You might have done similar projects before and might be aware of the answer to the common problems. However, do not hurry into finishing research and jump to design. Chances are one will overlook the critical points. However obvious this may sound, you will still try to develop a solution due to the client's demand or tight timeline. Instead, the first step is to get a clear brief from the client. And remember that this is not easy! A summary can't be too brief, and it still needs to carry all the details that cannot afford to be missed by any of the stakeholders. Some of the questions I have personally asked myself in this process are —
- Is researching the given inquiry worthwhile? And do I personally or the studio/client/or other relevant stakeholders understand the significance and nature of conducting detailed research?
- Research cannot be not detailed. And many people, especially students doing the research, often find them amidst of nowhere. Is it necessary to ask or define the scope of your research? Where it starts and where it ends? Questioning is vital, whether projects that have definite deadlines or not.
- State your assumptions and clear objective in a manner where there are less as possible alternate interpretations. "There is nothing obvious."

## Debrief
Inflate the brief. Detail out the objective, intent, requirements, and everything necessary for the research and make sure it is in conjunction with the client. Build an understanding of the client – get closer to the problem; this might help in empathizing. User research is a very exhaustive process when done in its fullest. Many times if the scope is not defined correctly, there are chances that you would not be able to keep up with the timeline and not be able to identify the closure.

## Plan
At this stage, one should have everything to begin the research. Yes, the actual research has not started yet. Your vision now should reflect the objective of this inquiry. You can now begin to identify sources to carrying out this research (such as technical papers, interviews, and visiting the user). The plan will be the primer for the study – the process, methods, deliverables will be its ingredients. While there may be hundreds of techniques and deliverables already out there, generalized for specific contexts to be applied, but sometimes it is not sufficient to follow the existing schema. They may need improvisation, and planning here means thinking ahead and selecting what will be relevant here. Of course, there may be detours, but that is part of this process. The plan then will be your recipe of how you would do your research.

## Research (and Observe)
However simple this may sound; this is exhaustive and is worthless if you don't have a clear plan. Don't decide the solution or result before actually reaching there by the facts.

The chances are that one will not be able to find if he is biased by himself. Peer reviews can be of help here. Organize and document the research, and don't be afraid of picking facts that may not sound relevant directly. The mode of the investigation drives the quality of the study. What is the information that comes from the target user, and what happens from the publications or experts? Many researchers select users based on ease of accessibility. Picking friends and family for the user study for the research who does not qualify in the desired target group should never be done. The sample size is another thing that is critical and should always have a basis. Also, It is hard to end the research because one may not know that if this research will suffice the intent set in the plan or not, and this is why that analysis of the study should happen simultaneously with the investigation.

## Synthesis
Synthesis is often the final step before the research is applied; you need to identify the underlying patterns from the facts collected till now into (valuable) insights and possible (actionable) implications. The selection of methods will be based on the kind of research till now, and don't be afraid of applying multiple ways to the same observation to find hidden patterns. Stay away from personal opinions by stating them at every stage, and in case if one considers a possible model but not enough evidence, go back to the research. The insights eventually form the basis of decisions that you or designer would take to improve their design.

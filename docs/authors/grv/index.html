<p>Mathematical researcher, who thinks and lives algorithms.</p>

<p>I’m the founder of Mathscapes Research and co-founder of M56 Design Lab with two of my friends. Most of my work lies in the union of mathematics and computer science. I’m mostly self-taught in the areas of my research. My research explores mathematical boundaries in the context of computer science and speculating possibilities in future by pushing these boundaries, which is also the basis of the Mathscapes vision.</p>

<p>After completing my degree in Computer Science &amp; Engineering, I studied Innovation and Experience Design in my masters. Later, I spent a year as a research assistant at Art in Transit project and then started working as a full-time faculty member at Srishti Institute of Art, Design &amp; Technology, Bangalore between 2016-Present. At Srishti, I facilitate studios related to Algorithms, Computation, and HCI. My time at Srishti has been both memorable and eye-opening – and informed a lot of decisions that shaped who I am today.</p>

<p><em>Our world is unavoidably complex. And to design is not to avoid complexity but to embrace complexity. The process of design deals with this complexity and translates it into an illusion of simplicity.</em></p>

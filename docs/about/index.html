  <h1>About Mathscapes</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>A Vision for the Technology of the Future</p>

<p><strong>Mathscapes Research is committed to advance in the field of algorithm design through mathematical research.</strong></p>

<p>Mathscapes study and design algorithms for computational problems. We see algorithmic complexity more than just space and time; examine how maths may be used to discover and build on other possible parameters that contribute to this complexity.</p>

<p>Our projects are primarily research-based and include both — initiated by ourselves and commissioned. Beyond that, we are always keen to undertake projects that pivot on Mathematics and Computer Science.</p>

<p><strong>Mathscapes’ pursuit is to revolutionise the way, world engages with technology.</strong> Technology is constantly changing our world. It is everything that is making our work or life simpler. While that may be a good thing, we cannot anticipate all the implications. Who should be held responsible for damage caused by this advancement? <em>What if we could see the future? Would we change our decisions then?</em></p>

<p>Technology is what we believe is the consequence of life. Like life, technology may also be inevitable, or maybe both are the same? And at this point, we are probably at the ascent of the exponential curve of the supermassive technology outbreak. How much exaggerating it may sound, it seems inevitable. Will we able to coexist with it? And If so, how technology should evolve optimally? <em>What should we do now to change the future?</em></p>

<!-- ## Scapes

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>Our process starts by distilling the complexity into a precise formal language. We dig deep to research about the subject and try to illustrate every minute aspect that is appearing to affect the system. Often the most simple looking problems are the hardest ones. And we are living in a world with limited resources and constraints, where technology must be optimized to make the most of it. This very point brings us to maths – it sets up the foundation for us to theorize the patterns, conjectures, and design algorithms more efficiently.</p>

<p>We foremost focus on computational efficiency, and consequently, other kinds of ability when it is put into the larger picture. The journey of a mathematical model begins by discovering and studying the raw patterns. And then developing conjectures that can potentially explain why we think something is happening the way it is happening. And finally putting all the possible hard work in proving the conjecture to support our study.</p>

<h2 id="team">Team</h2>
<p>We are a small team at the moment, and people from various disciplines are brought together based on the kind of project we do. Our expertise ranges from Mathematics, Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction and Graphic design.</p>

<p><strong>Founder.</strong> Gaurav Singh</p>

<h2 id="commission">Commission</h2>
<p>Mathscapes is available to undertake commissioned projects related to following categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Complexity Analysis</strong> provides theoretical estimates of the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given computational problem.</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithm Design</strong> determines a set of instructions in a well-defined formal language to solve computational problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Mathematical Research</strong> examines the underlying abstract contexts to obtain pure mathematical results which can be utilized to develop applied mathematics.</li>
  <li><strong>Mathematical Modelling</strong> provides a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language.</li>
  <li><strong>Mathematical Visualization</strong> depicts graphical representation of a complex algorithm or mathematical model.</li>
  <li><strong>Research Mentorship</strong> provides one-on-one mentorship to who seek guidance for a research project that involves mathematics, computer science or human-computer interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Training and Workshop</strong> facilitates learning/hackathons for large groups typically in full day formats.</li>
</ul>

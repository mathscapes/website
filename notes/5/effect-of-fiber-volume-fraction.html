<h1>Effect of Fiber Volume Fraction on Composite Response under Ballistic Impact load </h1>

<p>Rahul Singh / October 18, 2018 / Posted in Assembly / Tagged as Damage Mechanics</p>

<p>Fiber volume fraction is the ratio which decides on the amount of fiber material and resin presence in the manufacturing of composites. Hence, this ratio plays a significant role in the determining the elastic properties of the material. It is necessary to have the right amount of mix as a minor change in the properties can bring about a catastrophic failure. In the present study, we strive to investigate the variation in the elastic parameters of the material.</p>

<p>The study investigates the effect by simulating a ballistic impact load over a lamina with varying fiber volume fraction. The elastic parameters are calculated using the rules of mixture and are then used to determine the response of lamina subjected to ballistic impact. </p>

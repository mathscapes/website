<h1>A Micromechanic-based approach towards the Response of Fiber-reinforced Composite Laminates under ballistic impact and blast loading</h1>

<p>Rahul Singh / June 21, 2018 / Posted in Assembly / Tagged as Damage Mechanics</p>

<p>Composites material are a significant part of a wide variety of applications such as bulletproof vests of soldiers on a battlefield to the passenger jet airliners. The dynamic and multitudinous forces of nature acting on these composites push the materials towards complex deformations, answers to which involves extensive work using numerical techniques, in order to save the expenditure involved in testing and experimentation. </p>

<p>In the present study, an attempt has been made to solve this challenging problem to predict the response of composite laminates under ballistic impact and blast loading conditions by implementing a progressive damage based micro-mechanical model for unidirectional composite laminates and fiber metal laminates.</p>
